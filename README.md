# TypeScript Website

This is the current website for TypeScript. It uses Jekyll for the majority of the work, and uses git-submodules for the playground and the handbook.

### Meta

* __URLs:__ [production](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [staging](http://testsite-typescript-41eeb979-7eaa-4c74-9d47-9d182c7b61ab.azurewebsites.net/)

## Staging

A live version with the daily build can be found [here](http://typescript:3000).

## Configure your build environment:

1. Install the latest Ruby and add it to your environment's PATH during setup. Allow the installer to install MSYS2 via `ridk install`.
    * Download Ruby [from here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
1. Install the latest Node.js.
    * Download Node.js [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Establish your new environment by opening up a new PowerShell/Command Prompt.
1. Fork https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Website to your own GitHub account
1. Clone https://github.com/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/TypeScript-Website
1. Run the following from the cloned repository:

    ```shell
    gem install bundler
    bundler install

    yarn install
    npm install -g gulp-cli

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    cd src/play
    yarn install
    yarn setup
    cd ../..
    ```

## Build the site:

Ensure that you have configured your build environment as explained above.
In a shell, navigate to your clone of this repository and run:

```shell
gulp
```

Your default web browser should start up and show the built site.

**Note:** If you want to make changes to the playground, you have a bit of a dance to do. Run ^ then
press save on a file inside both the `examples/` subfolder, and the `src/play` subfolder. The playground
is a submodule, so that'll need a PR to a different repo.


## Deployment

Deployment is automatic:

- Merges to the branch `archived` deploy to staging.
- Pushes to the branch `release` deploy to production. You can use: `git push origin origin/master:release`.

To deploy manually, first use these commands to push [to staging](http://testsite-typescript-41eeb979-7eaa-4c74-9d47-9d182c7b61ab.azurewebsites.net/):

```sh
# Creates a ./site folder
gulp publish

# Pushes to a staging
gulp deploy

# Syncs production with staging
sh sync-staging-to-prod.ps1
```
