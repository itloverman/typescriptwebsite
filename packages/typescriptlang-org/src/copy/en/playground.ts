  // You could think of it in three ways:
  //
  //  - A place to learn TypeScript in a place where nothing can break
  //  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax, and share the URLs with others
  //  - A sandbox to experiment with different compiler features of TypeScript

  // Compiler flag information is all from the tsconfig reference info
