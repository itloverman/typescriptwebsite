## Playground Plugins

The Playground aims to cover nearly all of the key features you might want in a sandbox-ed environment for writing TypeScript. The Playground plugins system allows the Playground to be extended in new directions.

There are three main categories of plugins as of 2021:

#### Playground Extensions

Plugins like [Presentation Mode]() and [Codeblock Examples]() make it easy to use the Playground as a live-coding environment for presenting to others. Prettier and Link Shortener help you use other tools when working, and the Vim plugin adds Vim keybindings to the playground!

#### Introspection Tools

Plugins like [Transformer Timeline](), [Code Show Flow](), [TS Scanner](), [Live Transformer]() and [TS Symbols]() are plugins which help you to understand how TypeScript understands the code you have written.

#### Exporting Information

Plugins like [TypeScript JSON Schema](), [Dts Plugin]() and [@structuredtypes/plugin]() take the code you write in the editor and transform it into another format.

Anyone can create a plugin, if you're interested you can learn more in [Writing Plugins]().
