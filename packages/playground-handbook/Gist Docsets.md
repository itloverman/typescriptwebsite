### Gist Docsets

If you want to explain something which requires looking at a problem from many angles, or feel like there's value in interspersing text - you can create a Playground Docset powered by a GitHub Gist. These docsets are generated at runtime from the `.ts` and `.md` files inside a gist which create you separately from the Playground.

For example, to re-create the 2020 blog post series `Type | Treat` you can see https://gist.github.com/303ebff59a6fc37f88c86e86dbdeb0e8 - the URL for loading this into the Playground is:

```
https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#gist/303ebff59a6fc37f88c86e86dbdeb0e8-6
//                                       ^ gist id                        ^ page
```
