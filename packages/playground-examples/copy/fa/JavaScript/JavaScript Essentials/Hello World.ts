// The playground makes it easy for you to safely experiment
// with ideas in TypeScript by making it trivial to share
// these projects. The URL for this page is everything
// required to load the project for someone else.

const hello = 'سلام'

// You can see on the right the result of the TypeScript
// compiler: this is vanilla JavaScript which can run on
// browsers, servers or anywhere really.

const world = 'دنیا'

// You can see how it makes tiny changes to the code, by
// converting a "const" to a "var". This is one of the many
// things TypeScript does to make it possible to run
// anywhere JavaScript runs.

console.log(hello + ' ' + world)

// Now that you have an idea of how the playground works,
// let's look at how TypeScript makes working with
// JavaScript more fun. During this section we'll be trying
// to keep as close to vanilla JavaScript as possible to
// show how you can re-use existing knowledge.
