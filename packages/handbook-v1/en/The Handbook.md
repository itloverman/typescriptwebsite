## About this Handbook

The TypeScript handbook aims to teach JavaScript engineers how TypeScript works.

TypeScript is a language which extends JavaScript, and there are many great resources for learning JavaScript on the internet.

If you are coming to TypeScript without a JavaScript background, with the intention of TypeScript being your first language, we recommend you first start reading the documentation [on JavaScript at the Mozilla Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide).
If you have experience in other languages, you should be able to pick up JavaScript syntax quite quickly by reading the handbook.

## How is this Handbook Structured

The handbook is split into two sections:

- **The Handbook**

  This handbook is built to give you a firm understanding of the ways in which TypeScript extends JavaScript in everyday code, you can read the handbook by going from top to bottom in the left-hand navigation.

  The handbook starts at <a href="/docs/handbook/basic-types.html">Basic Types</a>.

* **The Handbook Reference**

  The handbook reference is built to provide a richer understanding of how a particular part of TypeScript works. You can read it top-to-bottom, but each section aims to provide a deeper explanation of a single concept - meaning there is no aim for continuity.
