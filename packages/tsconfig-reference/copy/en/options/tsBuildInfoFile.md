display: "TS Build Info File"

Specify file to store incremental compilation information as a part of composite projects which allow for faster
building of larger TypeScript codebases. You can read more about composite projects [in the handbook](/docs/handbook/project-references.html). 

This option offers a way to configure the place where TypeScript keeps track of the files it stores on the disk to 
indicate a project's build state - by default they are in the same folder as your emitted JavaScript.
