display: "Trace Resolution"
---

When you are trying to debug why a module isn't being included you can enable `traceResolutions` to have TypeScript output text to the console as it resolves each file.
You can read more about this in [the handbook](/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#tracing-module-resolution)
