display: "Composite"
---

The `composite` option enforces certain constraints which make it possible for build tools (including TypeScript 
itself, under `--build` mode) to quickly determine if a project has been built yet.

When this setting is on:

 * The `rootDir` setting, if not explicitly set, defaults to the directory containing the `tsconfig.json` file.

 * All implementation files must be matched by an `include` pattern or listed in the `files` array. If this constraint is violated, `tsc` will inform you which files weren't specified.

 * `declaration` defaults to `true`
