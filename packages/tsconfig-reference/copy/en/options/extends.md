The value of `extends` is a string which contains a path to another configuration file to inherit from. 

The configuration from the base file are loaded first, then overridden by those in the inheriting config file. All relative paths found in the configuration file will be resolved relative to the configuration file they originated in.

It's worth noting that `files`, `include` and `exclude` from the inheriting config file *overwrite* those from the 
base config file, and that circularity between configuration files is not allowed.

##### Example

`configs/base.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

`tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "./configs/base",
  "files": [
    "main.ts",
    "supplemental.ts"
  ]
}
```

`tsconfig.nostrictnull.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": false
  }
}
```
