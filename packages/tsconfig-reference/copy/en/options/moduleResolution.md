display: "Module Resolution"
oneline: "How TypeScript looks up a file based from a module specifier."

Specify the module resolution strategy: `'node'` (Node.js) or `'classic'` (used in TypeScript before the release of 1.6).
You probably won't need to use `classic` in modern code.

There is a handbook reference page on [Module Resolution](/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)
