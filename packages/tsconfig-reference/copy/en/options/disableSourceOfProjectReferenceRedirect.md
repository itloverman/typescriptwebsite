display: "Disable Source Project Reference Redirect"

When working with composite TypeScript projects, this option provides a way to go [back to the pre-3.7](/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#build-free-editing-with-project-references) behavior where d.ts files were used to as the boundaries between modules. 
In 3.7 the source for truth is now your TypeScript files.
