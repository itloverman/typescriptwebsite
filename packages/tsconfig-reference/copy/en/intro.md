## Intro to the TSConfig Reference

A TSConfig file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript or JavaScript project.
The TSConfig file can be either a `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`, both have the same behavior and the same set of config variables.

This page covers all of the different flags available inside a TSConfig file. Starting with the root attributes which relate to project management, then moving to the compiler settings and finally wrapping with options for configuring the watch mode's fallbacks.
