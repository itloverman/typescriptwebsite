// Without a background in type theory, you're unlikely
// to be familiar with the idea of a type system being "sound"

// Soundness is the idea that the compiler can make guarantees
// about what types are available at runtime, and not just
// during compilation.

// Building a type system for a language is a trade-off with
// three qualities: Simplicity, Usability and Soundness.

// By aiming to support all JavaScript code, TypeScript 
// varies its 

// code. While runtime safety is an important requirement, 
// usability is another important one. 

// One of these usability trade-offs is in having a completely
// sound type-system vs having a type system that maps to real
// world usage of JavaScript
