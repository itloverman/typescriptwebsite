# TypeScript Example Code

These samples are built for hyperlinking between each-other 
in a sandboxed environment like the TypeScript Playground.

Each example aims to cover one or two specific features to
either how JavaScript works in TypeScript, or features which
TypeScript has added to the language.

An example should make assumptions that the reader is in a
monaco/IDE-like environment which has a TSServer running for
to provide extra analysis. As well as a minor fluency in 
JavaScript.

These examples are not set in stone, and we're open to new 
ideas. If you'd like to help out and speak more than one
language, we'd love to see translations.
